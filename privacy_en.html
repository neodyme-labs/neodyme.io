        <h3>II. General Information on Data Processing</h3>
        <p>
            Data protection is of particular significance to us. Therefore, we only collect and use personal data of our
            users insofar as is required to provide our content and services and a functioning website. Personal data
            includes all information referring to an identified or identifiable natural person (“Person Concerned” in
            the following).
        </p>
        <p>
            The collection and use of personal data of our users is always conducted in accordance with the GDPR and the
            applicable national data protection laws and provisions. If the processing of personal data is required, and
            such processing is not allowed by statutory regulations, we always seek the consent of the Person Concerned.
        </p>
        <p>
            In general, we do not transfer personal data to third parties. A transfer only takes place, if you have
            given your express consent (Art. 6 Sec. 1 p. 1 lit. a GDPR); if a legitimate interest in such transfer
            exists and there is no reason to assume that you have an overriding and legitimate interest in you data not
            being transferred (Art. 6 Sec. 1 p. 1 lit. f GDPR); if a transfer is necessary for compliance with a legal
            obligation (Art. 6 Sec. 1 p. 1 lit. c GDPR); or if a transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract
            to which you are a party (Art. 6 Sec. 1 p. 1 lit. b GDPR).
        </p>

        <h3>III. Visits on our Website</h3>
        <p>
            When you visit our website neodyme.io, the browser you use automatically sends information to the server on
            our website. The following information are collected and stored until automatic deletion:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                IP address of the accessing computer,
            </li>
            <li>
                Time and date of the server request,
            </li>
            <li>
                name and URL of the file,
            </li>
            <li>
                Referrer URL,
            </li>
            <li>
                Browser type and browser version,
            </li>
            <li>
                Host name of the accessing computer.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>These data are only stored temporarily in a so-called log file. Not affected by this are the IP addresses of
            the user or other data that allow the assignment of the data to a user. A storage of this data together with
            other personal data of the user does not take place. When using this data, we draw no conclusions about the
            person concerned.</p>
        <p>The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 Sec. 1 p. 1 lit. f GDPR. The legitimate interest in the meaning
            of the GDPR is providing a working website with properly delivered content, optimizing our systems and
            providing law enforcement with the information needed to prosecute cyberattacks. As soon as there is no
            legitimate interest and there is no statutory retention requirement, these data will routinely deleted.</p>

        <p>This website is hosted by an external service provider (hoster). The aforementioned contents of the server
            log are stored on the hoster's servers. The hoster is used for the purpose of providing our website and in
            the legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f) DSGVO to provide the website quickly,
            securely and efficiently.</p>
        <p>Our hoster will process your data only insofar as this is necessary for the fulfillment of its required
            service obligations
            and complies with our instructions regarding this data.</p>

        <p>
            Where that is the case, you may obtain from the Controller access to the personal data and information on
            the purposes of the processing; the categories of personal data concerned; the recipients or categories of
            recipient to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed; where possible, the envisaged period for
            which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period.

        <h3>3. Right to Erasure (Art. 17 GDPR)</h3>
        <p>
            You have the right to obtain from the Controller the erasure of personal data stored by us, if the personal

            processed; if you withdraw consent on which the processing is based, and where there is no other legal
            ground for the processing; if you object to the processing pursuant to Art. 21, Sec. 1 GDPR and there are no
            overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or you object to the processing pursuant to Article 21,

            This right to erasure does not apply to the extent that processing is necessary for exercising the right of
            freedom of expression and information; for compliance with a legal obligation; for reasons of public
            interest; or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

            data is contested by you, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data;
            if the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of the personal data and request the restriction of
            their use instead; if the Controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing,
            but they are required by you for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or if you have
            objected to processing pursuant to Art. 21 Sec. 1 GDPR, pending the verification whether the legitimate
            grounds of the Controller override those of you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Where processing has been restricted, such personal data shall, with the exception of storage, only be
            processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or for the
            protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of
            the Union or of a Member State.
        </p>
